# Milestone-4-Interactive-Vis-Implementation

Welcome to my interactive visualization project, which delves into the global trends of female employment-to-population ratios from 1960 to 2021 to accompany with my poem on global female empowerment over time. This project is a fusion of narrative and exploratory data analysis that offers a unique and engaging user experience.

**Implementation Overview**

The features detailed in the initial design concept have been fully realized, albeit with slight modifications to enhance usability and interactivity. While certain visual elements may vary from the initial proposals, these adjustments were necessary to optimize the interactive features and overall user experience.

**Key Interactive Features**

This visualization is enriched with several interactive elements designed to captivate and inform:

_Reflective Transition_: The map is introduced with a gradual transition that mirrors the poetic theme of reflection, enhancing the connection between the visual and the narrative.

_Birthplace Focus_: When the second verse is reached, the map automatically zooms in to highlight China, my place of birth, and displays the worldwide female employment-to-population ratio for the year 2002.

_Dynamic Temporal Animation_: During the third verse, the map displays a dynamic, animated visualization that represents the shifts in female employment over time, marked by a notification that draws the viewer's attention to the ongoing animation.

_'Global' Interaction_: The term "global" within the poem is interactive. Clicking it initiates a golden highlight that spans the entire map, emphasizing the connectedness of the data.

**Custom Interactions**:

A _drop-down menu_ allows the audience to select and view specific continents with fluid transitions.
A slider bar lets users manually explore the data across different years.
Hovering over a country presents a tooltip with the country's name and its female employment ratio for the selected year.
Clicking on a country summons a line graph that tracks the female employment trends for that country from 1960 to 2021.
Feedback Integration

Constructive feedback from HW 4 - Scrollytelling has been integrated, ensuring that visual elements reset appropriately when navigating between verses and that transitions are seamless.

**Optimal Viewing Guidelines**

For the optimal viewing experience, please adjust your display settings to a viewport size of 2476 x 3199 pixels.

**Navigating the Experience**

Embark on an immersive journey that intertwines poetry with data visualization. Traverse through historical data, explore geographical data nuances, and uncover the narrative embedded in the evolution of female employment.

Thank you for exploring this project. Your insights and critiques are invaluable for the continual enhancement of this interactive exploration.
